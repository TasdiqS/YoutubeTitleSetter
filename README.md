# YoutubeTitleSetter
This repository hosts a Java project focused on interacting with the YouTube API to retrieve and set video titles for YouTube videos. The project is designed to simplify the process of updating them programmatically. It can be used as a foundation for applications that require automated video title management on YouTube.
